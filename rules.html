    <h2>Score & points</h2>
    <p>The basic unit is the line, to create one you need 3 blocks aligned.</p>
    <p>Each line is worth one point. Each additional block on a line is 1 point (a line of 5 blocks is 3 points).</p>
    <p>If you create a cross or a corner (an horizontal and a vertical line combined) they count as a single line and the block used to join them is counted twice. So it's a least 5 points.</p>
    <p>Finally if you do multiple lines at the same time, you'll get the sum of each individual score multiplied by the number of lines.</p>


    <h2>Single player modes</h2>

    <h3>Classic</h3>

    <h3>Wide</h3>
    <p>The classic mode is too easy ? Try this one, it's the same with more columns.</p>

    <h3>Sandbox</h3>
    <p>The ground won't move, the rain wont fall. Take your time to train your combos. You can still use the "Speed up" key to add new lines to the grid.</p>
    <h3>Campaign - Puzzle</h3>

    <h3>Campaign - Arcade</h3>

    <h3>Campaign - Time attack</h3>
    <p>You have a limited time to score.</p>
    <h3>Campaign - Tetris attack</h3>

    <p>A clone of Tetris attack's puzzle mode.</p>
    <h2>Multiplayer modes</h2>

    <h3>Split screen</h3>

    <p>Same rules as the single player mode "Classic" with 2 players. Each time you score 3 points, some blocks will
        fall in your partners grid.</p>

    <h3>Coop</h3>

    <p>Same rules as the single player mode "Wide" but you can play with a friend.</p>
