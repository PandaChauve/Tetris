        <p>WWYL is a game about survival in the ruthless world of falling blocks.</p>

        <p>The concept is quite simple, you can swap blocks horizontaly, when 3 or more blocks of a same color are
            aligned (verticaly or horizontaly) they're destroyed.</p>

        <div class="page-header"><h1>Score & points</h1></div>
        <p>The basic unit is the line, to create one you need 3 blocks aligned.</p>

        <p>Each line is worth one point. Each additional block on a line is 1 point (a line of 5 blocks is 3
            points).</p>

        <p>If you create a cross or a corner (an horizontal and a vertical line combined) they count as a single line
            and the block used to join them is counted twice. So it's a least 5 points.</p>

        <p>Finally if you do multiple lines at the same time, you'll get the sum of each individual score multiplied by
            the number of lines. The same effect is applied if you create lines with falling blocks.</p>

            <h1>Single player modes</h1>
        </div>
        <h2>Arcade</h2>

        <h3>Classic</h3>

        <p>The classic mode is a survival game in a 6X10 grid. Blocks will fall from the top and the grid is going
            up at an increasing speed. The more you play, the harder it gets !</p>

        <p>Tips : at the beginning the game is slow, it's easier to create big combinations. You should use the
            speed key to insure a sufficient block pool for your combos. When the game start to be too fast for you,
            focus on destroying small blocks, the more you play the more you score !</p>

        <h3>Wide/Narrow</h3>

        <p>The classic mode is too easy ? Try one of these one, it's the same in a different grid.</p>

        <h3>Crazy</h3>

        <p>Not yet implemented, come back later :)</p>

        <h3>Sandbox</h3>

        <p>The ground won't move, the blocks wont fall. Take your time to train your combos. You can still use the
            "Speed
            up" key to add new lines to the grid.</p>

        <h2>Campaign</h2>

        <h3>Challenges</h3>

        <p>No falling blocks, no moving ground, just some objectives and constraints. Reach a score, destroy all the
            blocks, destroy only one color, keep only a color,... You'll need your brain.</p>

        <h3>Arcade</h3>

        <p>Do you remember the arcade modes (classic, wide, crazy) ? It's that with a chance to win ! Stay in game long
            enough !</p>

        <h3>Time attack</h3>

        <p>You have a limited time to score a certain amount of points. Some grids are randomly generated, other are not
            !</p>

        <h3>Tetris attack</h3>

        <p>You have a limited amount of swaps to destroy all the blocks. This is a clone of Tetris Attack's puzzle mode,
            60 levels of increasing difficulty. All the levels can be completed with 5 sec between each swap, you don't
            need to try skillful moves.</p>

        <h2>Split screen</h2>

        <p>Same rules as the single player mode "Classic" with 2 players. Each time you score 3 points, some blocks will
            fall in your partners grid. Show that you're the best</p>

        <h2>Coop</h2>

        <p>Same rules as the single player mode "Wide" but you can play with a friend.</p>
